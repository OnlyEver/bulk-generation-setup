Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the *Völsunga saga*: when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound.

Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter.

Return an empty array if the generate_cards is false.\n2. **Summarization Objective**: Each card is a step in a journey through the content. The series should collectively summarize the source while emphasizing important learning points.\n3. **Character Limit**: Maintain a limit of 320 characters per card to ensure each message is concise yet informative.\n4. **Card limit**: Limit the total number of cards to less than or equal to 8.\n4. **Engagement and Flow**: Write in an engaging style that maintains the user’s interest.

In the event a license is coupled with an interest, the licensor must provide reasonable time for the licensee to remove that interest from the property prior to termination.

In certain cases, however, licenses can be made irrevocable, and specific performance may be granted. Where a license is made with a set term period and valid consideration is transferred, revocation of the license prior to the terms expiration may raise breach of contract claims that could provide damages against the licensor.
